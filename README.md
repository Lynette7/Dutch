# Dutch

Paying for group expenses and waiting for reimbursement can be a daunting task. Traditional financial management apps may offer a way to track expenses, but they don't guarantee that everyone will pay you back. This leaves you hoping and praying that your friends fulfill their financial obligations. Dutch provides a decentralized and trustless solution to the problem of group expense sharing. With Spltit, you no longer have to rely on the trustworthiness of others or chase them for payments. The app ensures that each member pays their own share, eliminating the burden of freeloaders in this increasingly complex economy. Dutch implements transparency by ensuring members approve withdrawal for payment after they've all contributed and reached the target.
